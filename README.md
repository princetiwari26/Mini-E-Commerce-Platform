## üß† Smart Search

Implemented a simple full-text search using PostgreSQL's `ILIKE` for case-insensitive matching. This allows users to search products by title, description, or category with partial or contextual matches.

---

## üì∑ Image Upload with Cloudinary

Product images are uploaded and hosted via [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). Credentials must be stored securely in the `.env` file:

```js
cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
```
